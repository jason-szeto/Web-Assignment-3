                    I am Currently in my 4th year of study and my main degree is computer science! I had an interest in computers at an early age and built my first computer 
                    in high school. I had a basic idea of what coding was and what the languages were with python and C++ being the more prominent ones. So far, through this degree I am
                    thoroughly enjoying this degree. I have taken courses such as: programming paradigms, algorithms and complexity, games development and data structures. I learn a new 
                    coding language after every one of these classes and have learned that math and coding are very similar to each other that it can be scary sometimes!

                    I was born in Calgary, Alberta and am of Chinese descent. I have lived in Calgary my entire life and grew up with mostly music and video games. I volunteered
                    during the summer and took language classes during the weekend throughout k-12 being quite fluent in cantonese.

                    One hobby of mine is that I enjoy hiking a lot. This picture was taken when hiking through powderface ridge trail that I was taking with 
                    my friends. It is a nice way to build cardio and to just get out of the house once in awhile to stay active and be able to interact with others.

                    I joined a hackathon sponsored by MRU called hackTogether. I joined a group of friends and coded a website that takes COVID-19 data from various canadian 
                    universities and aggregates it to the website so that university students don't need to sort through the clutter of traversing through the university website
                    to find the relevant COVID-19 info like the infected statistics.
